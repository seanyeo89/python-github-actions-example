Example for creating a simple CI/CD pipeline for a Python Project using Github Actions.

## What is CI/CD?
With the continuous method of software development, developers often continuously build, test, and deploy iterative code changes. This iterative process reduces the chance that new code created is  buggy . With this method, there is less human intervention or even no intervention at all, from the development of new code until its deployment.

## Continuous integration
Each change submitted to an application, even to development branches, is built and tested automatically and continuously. These tests ensure the changes pass all tests, guidelines, and code compliance standards you established for your application.

## Continuous deployment
Continuous deployment checks the code automatically, and does not requires human intervention to manually and strategically trigger the deployment of the changes. Through this, developer can reduce the routine manual labour and focus on higher value output.
